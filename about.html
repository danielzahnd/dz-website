Daniel Zahnd, born in 1995, has been married to Regula for five years. They live with their son in Rüschegg Heubach and are eagerly awaiting the arrival of a new family member who is currently on the way.

At the age of 18, following a tragic illness in the family, Daniel made the decision to follow Jesus Christ. This was a turning point that deeply shaped his life. Since then, he has been deeply engaged in exploring the credibility of the Bible.

Professionally, he completed an apprenticeship as an automation technician and went on to study physics, mathematics, and astronomy at the University of Bern, where he earned his Master's degree in Physics in 2024. As part of his studies, he also attended a philosophy lecture on proofs of God's existence, which he completed with a paper on the moral argument.

He is currently (2024–2028) pursuing a PhD in engineering sciences at the Swiss Federal Institute of Metrology.
