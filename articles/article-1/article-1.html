        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          This article is concerned with a heuristic derivation of the Benford law from first principles. It is shown in the paper, that the NBL arises from the requirement of scale invariance alone. Scale invariance means, that the mantissa $x$ of a number from a dataset has the same probability $p(x)\,\mathrm{d}x$ of being in the interval $[x, x + \mathrm{d}x]$, as $\lambda x$ has the probability $p(\lambda x)\,\mathrm{d}(\lambda x)$ of being in the interval $[\lambda x, \lambda x + \mathrm{d}(\lambda x)]$ for $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$. The possible range for $x$ or $\lambda x$ respectively is the interval $[1,10]$.
        </p>
        <p>
          The derived NBL is applied to a simulated dataset following the the Benford distribution, aswell as to various datasets of different nature.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Benford law was actually discovered by [Newcomb, 1881]. He observed, that the pages in logarithm books containing tables for logarithms with number one were much dirtier than the pages with logarithms of higher numbers. He proposed that the first digit $1$ is much more likely to occur in a dataset spanning many orders of magnitude than a higher number larger than one. [Benford, 1938] rediscovered this law later on and formalized it. Only through Theodore Hill however, the Benford law came to be known by a greater mathematical community, because he applied Benford's distribution to solve real world problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowadays, Benford's law is used to detect frauds in various kinds of datasets. What is important to note here is that the law is only applicable to datasets spanning many orders of magnitude. The reason for this will become more clear with a heuristic derivation given below.

        <h2>Derivation of the Newcomb-Benford law</h2>
        <p>
          Following [Burgos, 2021], Benford's law can be derived from scale invariance. Let $p(x)$ denote the probability density for the mantissa $x$ of some number $z = x\cdot 10^k$ with $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ to be in the interval $[1,10]$. 
          Scale invariance for $p(x)$ then means, that the probability $p(x)\,\mathrm{d}x$ of $x \in [x, x + \mathrm{d}x]$ is 
          equal to the probability $p(\lambda x)\,\mathrm{d}(\lambda x)$ of $\lambda x \in [\lambda x, \lambda x + \mathrm{d}(\lambda x)]$ for the 
          scaled probability density $p(\lambda x)$. From the normalization 
          condition \begin{align}\begin{aligned}\label{eq:normalizationcondition} \int_{1}^{10} p(x)\,\mathrm{d}x =& \int_{1}^{10} 
          p(\lambda x)\,\mathrm{d}(\lambda x) \\ =& \lambda \int_{1}^{10} p(\lambda x)\,\mathrm{d}x \overset{!}{=} 1 \end{aligned}\end{align} of probability densities, the relation \begin{equation} 
          p(\lambda x) = \lambda^{-1}p(x) \end{equation} follows. Differentiation \begin{equation} \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\lambda} 
          p(\lambda x) = x\frac{\mathrm{d}p(x)}{\mathrm{d}x}, \qquad \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\lambda}[\lambda^{-1}p(x)] = -\frac{1}{\lambda^2}p(x) \end{equation} 
          of both sides of \cref{eq:normalizationcondition} leads to the differential equation \begin{equation} 
          x\frac{\mathrm{d}p(x)}{\mathrm{d}x} = -\frac{1}{\lambda^2}p(x), \end{equation} which can be solved by 
          separation of variables. Dividing the differential equation by $x$ and $p(x)$ and furthermore integrating with 
          respect to $x$ leads to \begin{equation} \int \frac{1}{p(x)}\frac{\mathrm{d}p(x)}{\mathrm{d}x}\,\mathrm{d}x = 
          \int \frac{1}{p(x)}\,\mathrm{d}p(x) =  -\frac{1}{\lambda^2}\int \frac{1}{x}\,\mathrm{d}x. \end{equation} Performing the 
          indefinite integrals, one obtains \begin{equation} \ln[p(x)] = -\frac{1}{\lambda^2}\ln(x) + c, \quad c \in \mathbb{R}. \end{equation} 
          A this stage, one can set $\lambda =1$ and raise both sides of the equation to the power of Euler's number, which yields \begin{equation} p(x) = \tilde{c}\frac{1}{x}, 
          \end{equation} where $\tilde{c} = e^c$. This constant $\tilde{c}$ is given by the normalization condition $\int_{1}^{10}p(x)\,\mathrm{d}x\overset{!}{=}1$ as \begin{equation} 
          \tilde{c}\int_{1}^{10}\frac{1}{x}\,\mathrm{d}x = \tilde{c}\ln(10) = 1 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \tilde{c} = \frac{1}{\ln(10)},
          \end{equation} hence the Benford probability density $p(x)$ is given by \begin{equation}p(x) = \frac{1}{\ln(10)}x^{-1}.
          \end{equation} The probability $P(d)$ that the first digit of a number $z = x\cdot 10^k$ is the integer $d \in \{1,2,\dots,9\}$ is therefore given by \begin{align}\begin{aligned}
          P(d) &= \int_{d}^{d+1}p(x)\,\mathrm{d}x = \frac{1}{\ln(10)}\int_{d}^{d+1}\frac{1}{x}\,\mathrm{d}x \\ &= \frac{1}{\ln(10)}[\ln(d+1)-\ln(d)] \\ &= \frac{1}{\ln(10)}\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{d}\right).
          \end{aligned}\end{align} Let $a$, $b$ and $c$ be numbers, such that $\log_a(c) = b$ is a well-defined expression. Then, $a^b = c$ holds and hence also $\log_b(a^b) = \log_b(c) = b\log_b(a)$ must hold. From this, the change of basis rule \begin{equation}
          \log_a(c) = \frac{\log_b(c)}{\log_b(a)}\end{equation} follows. Using this rule, 
          one obtains $\ln(10)^{-1} = \log(e)$ and $\ln(1+1/d) = \log(1+1/d)/\log(e)$. Thus, the final expression \begin{equation}
          P(d) = \log\left(1 + \frac{1}{d}\right)\end{equation} for the Newcomb-Benford law is obtained. A dataset 
          $Z \doteq \{z_1,\dots,z_n\}$ consisting of $n \in \mathbb{N}$ numbers is said to follow a Benford distribution, if \begin{equation}
          \frac{n_{d}}{n} \approx P(d) = \log\left(1+\frac{1}{d}\right)\end{equation} for all $d \in \{1,2,\dots,9\}$ holds, 
          where $n_{d}$ is the number of elements in $Z$ with first digit $d \in \{1,2,\dots,9\}$. Figure 1 shows the calculated values $P(d)$ following Benford's law.

        <h2>Methods</h2>

          <h3>Generated datasets</h3>
          <p>
            This section describes two methods for generating datasets, which should follow a Benford distribution. These methods were implemented and examined as part of this work.
          </p>

            <h4>Method 1: Sampling from uniform distributions</h4>
            <p>
              A method directly derivational on the premiss of scale invariance is based on sampling from uniform distributions of various intervals.
            </p>
            <figure>
              <img src="uniformscale.png" alt="Benford's law" class="figure-img">
              <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> <span class="figcaption-text">Dataset construction by sampling from uniform distributions of intervals $[0,a], [0,2a], \dots, [0,\lambda a]$.</span></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>  
              This method is illustrated with fig. 2 and is based on drawing samples 
              \begin{equation}
                z_{j} \sim U(0,ka), \quad k \in \{1,\dots,\lambda\}
              \end{equation}
              with $j \in \{1,\dots,n\}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ from uniform distributions $U(0,ka)$. The probability that a sample $z_j$ was drawn from the uniform distribution $U(0,ka)$ is herewith assumed to be \begin{equation}
                P(z_j \sim U[0,ka]) = \frac{1}{k}
              \end{equation} to account for the overlap of the various uniform distributions. Given such a construction, one would expect that the resulting dataset should follow a Benford distribution, since it is constructed solely on the assumption of scale invariance.
            </p>

            <h4>Method 2: Sampling from a logarithmic uniform distribution</h4>
            <p>
              There is an instructive way to generate a dataset following a Benford distribution. First of all, one has to recall, to which type of data Benford's law applies. Benford's law applies to data spanning many orders of magnitude, since scale invariance was required for the derivation. Data covering many orders of magnitude is typically processed on a logarithmic scale as shown in \cref{fig:logarithmicscale}. Now, an a priori assumption on a dataset spanning many orders of magnitude would be, that it is uniformly distributed over those magnitudes.
            </p>
            <figure>
              <img src="logarithmicscale.png" alt="Benford's law" class="figure-img">
              <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> <span class="figcaption-text">Logarithmic scale with base 10, ranging from $10^{-10}$ to $10^{10}$.</span></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              This is to say, that such a dataset can be generated by sampling data from a range $[10^{r^-}, 10^{r^+}]$ on a logarithmic scale. A sample $z_j$ for $j \in \{1,\dots,n\}$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$ therefore is obtained as \begin{equation}\label{eq:gensamples}
                z_j = 10^{r_j}, \quad r_j \sim U(r^-,r^+),
              \end{equation} where $U(r^-,r^+)$ denotes the uniform distribution between $r
              ^-$ and $r^+$ for $r^-$, $r^+ \in \mathbb{R}$. For an accordingly generated dataset, $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{n_d}{n} = P(d)$ should hold.
            </p>
          
          <h3>World population dataset</h3>
          <p>
            The current section describes the Newcomb-Benford law applied to investigate a real-world dataset, namely a dataset of country populations. The used country population dataset\footnote{Data source: World Bank Open Data, \url{https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL}, last accessed: June 09, 2024.} features population data for all countries on the world ranging from the period of 1970 to the year 2023. In a first step, only the first digits of country populations of one year (2022) were graphed and compared to the exact Newcomb-Benford law, whereas in a second step all data from 1970 to 2023 was used to compare it against the Benford law.
          </p>

          <h3>Bible numbers dataset</h3>
          <p>
            This section elucidates the method of the Newcomb-Benford law applied to a dataset of numbers that appear in the Bible. As a basis, the English American Standard Version (ASV) was used. Text files of this translation can be downloaded freely on the internet from various domains. From a text file containing the entire ASV Bible, chapter and verse numbers were removed, as they are not original to the intitial writings, but were added by translators and typewriters at later stages in time. From the resulting text file, all word- and digit-based numbers were extracted into a dataset containing all numbers mentioned in the Bible. Note, that the acquired dataset does not contain numbers used to reference sequential events, such as the word ``fourth'' in the sentence ``...and it was the fourth day...''.
